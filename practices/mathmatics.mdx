# Math Important Formulas

Here are some important math formulas:

### 1. Pythagorean Theorem

In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

### 2. Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is used to find the solutions (roots) of a quadratic equation of the form $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$.



### 3. Area of a Circle

The area of a circle with radius \(r\) is given by the formula:

$$
A = \pi r^2
$$

### 4. Area of a Rectangle

The area of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by:

$$
A = l \times w
$$

### 5. Sum of Arithmetic Series

The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic series with first term \(a_1\) and common difference \(d\) is given by:
